		<h2 class="title1">Moopon Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>We at gotokki, inc (creators of Moopon) believe there&#39;s a fundamental difference between you going to a business and disclosing information to a salesperson to get the best service, versus a marketer going through your trash to figure out who you are and what you bought in order to &#39;offer&#39; you most relevant service.  Obviously, going through someone&#39;s trash to offer relevant product pitches is clearly wrong... but, then why is it acceptable in the digital world?  It shouldn&#39;t be.  Moopon is an opt-in service where our users will tell us which merchants they like, what deals they redeem, and how they will share the deals with their friends.  We don&#39;t care about your average household income, what articles you read online, how many children you have, or even your gender... it&#39;s none of our business.   Moopon is not in the business of collecting your profile and usage to sell to online advertisers.  What we do is help you communicate with your local merchants.  Tell them how much you like their products and services by making them your favorites.  Tell them how valuable you are by redeeming tokens at their establishments.  Tell them how valuable you are by letting them know how you shared the merchant&#39;s deals with other potential customers.<p>

			<p>Because gotokki&#39;s fundamental goal is building a community of trust and respect, transparency and privacy is of utmost importance.  We will be as direct and open as we can in this Privacy Policy, so that it is easy to understand.  If there are any parts that you do not understand, please contact us at <a id="bodyemail" href="mailto:info@moopon.us?subject=Info query from Moopon Landing Page!">info@moopon.us</a></p>

			<p class="bump">Here are things we track:</p><br>
			<ul class="pl">
				<li>Your log-in information</li>	
				<li>Merchants you favorite</li>
				<li>Deals you redeemed, and the channel you redeemed them</li>
				<li>Your location, in the form of Preferred home zip code and/or GPS on your phone</li>
				<li>We may get additional information if you log-in using facebook connect.</li>
				<li>Information that pertains to performance of Moopon mobile application and web services.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="bump">Here are reasons why we track what we track:</p><br>
			<ul class="pl">
				<li>Merchant favorites help us to understand what types of merchants you like to use.  For example, if you hate coffee, and you never favorite a coffee shop... our algorithm will eventually figure this out, and you should see very little coffee shops from your discover screen.  All we want to do is to show you relevant merchants to you.   Admittedly, we aren&#39;t perfect... so, if you still see an occasional coffee shop in your discover screen... please forgive us.  We are doing our best to display relevant merchants to you.</li>
				<li>Deal redemption and method of sharing activities will help us to identify who the loyal Moopon users are.  We want to identify you, because we value you.  When we value you, good things will happen to you.   </li>
				<li>Your location will show us where you like to shop.  For Moopon to be most useful, you are going to want as many merchants around you to be Moopon merchants.   If we start seeing a large number of Moopon users in a certain area, guess where we will be sending our sales people to recruit Moopon merchants.</li>
				<li>Your location is also important to us to prevent fraudulent behavior.  As idealistic as we are, we understand that there are people who want to game systems.  We saw this with other location based applications, and we are tracking your location to prevent rogue users from gaming Moopon.  Fraud hurts our users, merchants, and us... and we want to protect all three entities as best as possible. </li>
				<li>Some information and data will be tracked to ensure best performance of Moopon&#39;s mobile application and web services.  This information could include IP address, cookie information, page requests, and other technical data that are relevant to the performance of our Service.  </li>
				<li>Additional information that we may get from Moopon users logging in with facebook connect is something we won&#39;t actively track.   All we care about is what merchants you favorite, how you share, and what you redeem.   Honestly, we integrated facebook connect for users who do not want to create another log-in name and password.  </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here are things we won&#39;t do:</p><br>
			<ul class="pl">
				<li>We won&#39;t send users daily emails soliciting Moopon or our merchants.  Our goal is to have Moopon users interact with us and merchants from our mobile application and our website.  We strongly believe email inboxes should be used for communication and not solicitation!</li>
				<li>We won&#39;t share Moopon user&#39;s email addresses or contact information with any merchants or third party advertisers.  WE HATE SPAM.  Moopon will act as a communication intermediary between our users and our merchants, but we will never hand over email addresses or any contact information to merchants and third party advertisers. </li>
				<li>We won&#39;t use your address books on your mobile phone to solicit Moopon or other merchants.  Did we mention how much we hate spam?  If you share your deal with someone who is not a Moopon member (via text, email, or Moopon invite), we will send them an email asking them to join Moopon.   We will not use their email address to send them Moopon solicitation without a friend request from a Moopon user.  </li>
				<li>We won&#39;t sell your raw individual data to anyone.  We have the right to provide aggregated data of Moopon users to our merchants.  We feel this is important so the merchants can provide rewards that are good enough to incentivize Moopon users.  </li>
			</ul>
			<p class="bump">Here are things we will do:</p><br>
			<ul class="pl">
				<li>We will comply with local, state, and Federal laws.  We will also comply with any reasonable requests from law enforcement agencies.  </li>
				<li>Information you provide to us, we will store them in a secured server and employ industry&#39;s best practices to keep your data secured.</li>
				<li>We will notify you from time to time to communicate major changes, upgrades, and significant events.  </li>
				<li>If you want to delete your account, we will remove all information regarding you from our system</li>
				<li>We will pull data from your mobile phone&#39;s address book, so that we can load them into Moopon&#39;s share screen.  This will help you to easily invite friends to join Moopon.  We thought this method would be better than having you type in individual email addresses from your phone.  </li>
				<li>This Privacy Policy may need to be amended from time to time... meaning this is a living document.  We will notify you when our policies change so that you can opt out at any time.   If you have any suggestions that could improve our Privacy Policy, please email them to <a id="bodyemail" href="mailto:info@moopon.us?subject=Info query from Moopon Landing Page!">info@moopon.us</a>, and put &#34;privacy policy suggestion&#34; as the subject line.</li>

There will be rules and restrictions to the sharing of tokens to minimize spamming and gaming.
